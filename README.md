# harry-potter-universe
 This website was built with the React.js library, the Next.js framework and styled with Tailwind.css

The purpose of this site is to test out pulling data from APIs using the 'getServerSideProps' function and then be able to filter the data via a searchbar and map the data to different points on the site.

This site pulls data from the Harry Potter API that can be found on github here: https://github.com/fedeperin/harry-potter-api-english#harry-potter-api

This site also uses a custom font that is stored locally on the hosting server.
